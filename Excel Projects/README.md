Hi, I'm Rishabh Pandey ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Finance Executive with a passion for transforming financial workflows through automation and smart Excel-based solutions. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to design and implement systems that streamline financial processes, from invoicing and reconciliation to cash flow management. My expertise lies in creating modular Excel templates, automating repetitive tasks, and ensuring data accuracy â€” all while optimizing the speed and efficiency of finance operations.

On this GitHub, youâ€™ll find a few of my projects that reflect my work in both finance and business analytics. These include a Sales Dashboard and a complex Business Analytics project, where I applied advanced Excel formulas, Pivot Tables, and MIS dashboards to analyze and present data in a user-friendly way.

In my career, Iâ€™ve:

Led the redesign of financial systems using Excel automation, saving hours of manual work each month.

Developed smart invoicing and reconciliation systems that improve accuracy and speed.

Worked on creating end-to-end solutions, from process development to team training and onboarding.

Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me
